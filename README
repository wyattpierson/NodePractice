Currently just a practice repo for my node.js work.
Messing around with different modules and such.

restify - a very basic REST API using restify. One file, no UI.
testAPI - an actual application. Also a REST API, but has a UI (ugly and basic),
	and more intricate configuration and functionality. Based off Express.

WARNING: This code is very much for testing and discovery purposes. 
It is inefficient and insecure in some places.
